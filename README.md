# Summary analysis of Locomotion experiments on the Multi-worm Tracker
The aim of this project is to create software that can be used after running
a 600s basal locomotion experiment using the Multi-worm tracker (Swierczek et al., 2011)
to generate summary figures and statistics for that experiment.

## Figures it generates
* Speed versus time over experiment duration
* Radial and boxplot pathlength figures from 530-590s
* Spontaneous reversals/minute box plot (averaged over 470-590s)
* Body size box plots (area, length and width)

## Statistics reported
* Mean initial speed (averaged over 30-45s) for each strain, and ANCOVA comparing to wild-type
* Mean final speed (averaged over 575-590s) for each strain, and ANCOVA comparing to wild-type
* Mean pathlength measured over 530-590s for each strain, and ANCOVA comparing to wild-type
* Mean number of spontaneous reversals/minute (averaged over 470-590s) for each strain, and ANCOVA comparing to wild-type
* Mean area, length and width for each strain, and ANCOVA comparing to wild-type

## How to use it
Instructions to come as code is developed.
